# Meet Discoveries

You can access this page using this link: https://wsvoboda.github.io/meet-discoveries/

This page pulls information from an API full of fake data. I wanted to create a page that provides the user with two buttons. One will fetch the data on people and one will fetch location data. 
#

The landing page cycles through five different pictures. They change every 4 seconds.

The user has two options, they can click the "Meet" button to see people interested in new friendships. They can also click on the "Discover" button to learn about different locations in the world!

If the user clicks on the "Meet" button, 30 users will pop up, and the page automatically scrolls down to view the people.

As mentioned above, the data is pulled from an API of fake data. The pictures are pulled from another source of fake user photos.

If the user clicks on the "Discover" button, 30 locations will pop up.

The data is pulled from an API of fake data. The API provides a lorem ipsum-type description. The images come from a lorem picsum-type site. 

The user can scroll back up at any time and click either button again to load more people or locations. The new data replaces the existing data on the screen.

This was also my first time creating a favicon!
